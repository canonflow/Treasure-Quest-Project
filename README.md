# About this Project

This is my first C# project that i made for Final Project of Algorithm and Programming at my university. So this project is based on the c# form which I modified to become a simple game. I hope you guys enjoy it. ðŸ˜Š

If you find an error such as <b>"Couldn't process file nameOfFile.resx due to its bring the internet or Restricted zone or having the mark of the web on the file. Remove the mark of the web if you want to process these files."</b> while you were running it on visual studio. You can fix it with the following steps:

1. Find TreasureQuest folder.
2. Find all files with <b>.resx</b> extention
3. Right click on the file, then select <b>Properties</b>.
4. Select <b>Unblock</b>, click <b>apply</b> and <b>ok</b>.
5. Applies to all files with the <b>.resx</b> extension such as <b>About.resx</b>, <b>Fake.resx</b>, <b>Home.resx</b>, and so forth.
